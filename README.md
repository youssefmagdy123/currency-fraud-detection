# 💵 Currency Fraud Detection

A machine learning–based project for detecting counterfeit currency using image processing and computer vision techniques.

This system classifies banknotes as **real or fake** by applying preprocessing, feature extraction (HOG), and SVM classification. The project demonstrates a complete ML pipeline from data loading to evaluation and visualization.
